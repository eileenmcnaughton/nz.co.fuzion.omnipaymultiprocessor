     * Confirm (Sage Pay Server only)

     * Direct). The return URL is called by their server, and they expect you to confirm receipt
     * and then pass a URL for them to forward the customer to.
     *
     * Because of this, an extra step is required. In your return controller, after calling
     * $gateway->completePurchase(), you should update your database with details of the
     * successful payment. You must then call $response->confirm() to notify Sage Pay you
     * received the payment details, and provide a URL to forward the customer to.
     *
     * Keep in mind your original confirmPurchase() script is being called by Sage Pay, not
     * the customer.
     *
     * @param string URL to foward the customer to. Note this is different to your standard
     *               return controller action URL.
